# Face Mask Detection

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts whether a person in an image is wearing a mask or not. The accurate detection of face masks is crucial for public health, especially in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. This project leverages deep learning techniques to classify images based on the presence or absence of face masks.

## Dataset Description
The project uses a dataset consisting of images categorized into two classes: "with_mask" and "without_mask." The dataset includes thousands of images that provide a diverse representation of individuals wearing masks and not wearing masks.

## Features
The dataset contains the following features:

- **Images**: Input images of individuals with and without masks.
- **Labels**: Corresponding labels indicating whether each image belongs to the "with_mask" or "without_mask" class.

## Modeling
The project involves training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify the images. The model architecture includes convolutional layers for feature extraction, pooling layers for downsampling, and dense layers for classification. The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy.
